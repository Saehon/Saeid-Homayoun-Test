# CAM/KAM AuditBERT — Public Reproducibility Package

## Research project
**AuditBERT: Revolutionizing KAM Disclosures with LLMs**

Collaboration associated with Saeid Homayoun, Zabihollah Rezaee, Maryam Khosravian, Salma Boumediene, and Salem L. Boumediene.

This repository folder is a **public-safe reproducibility layer** for the CAM/KAM AuditBERT research project. It intentionally does **not** redistribute the unpublished manuscript or raw licensed/proprietary audit datasets.

## Research objective
The project studies AI-assisted analysis of **Key Audit Matters (KAMs)** and **Critical Audit Matters (CAMs)**, including:
- accounting-topic classification,
- identification of audit-risk themes,
- assessment of KAM/CAM disclosure specificity,
- support for entity-specific audit-report drafting,
- benchmarking of domain-specific language models.

## Public files
- `synthetic_cam_kam_sample.csv` — synthetic demonstration records only.
- `prepare_cam_kam_data.py` — validates and prepares a private CAM/KAM dataset locally.
- `requirements.txt` — minimal Python dependencies.
- `DATA_SCHEMA.md` — research-variable schema.
- `SOURCE_MANIFEST.md` — provenance map without exposing private Drive identifiers.
- `README_HUGGINGFACE.md` — Hugging Face-ready dataset card.
- `dataset-metadata.json` — Kaggle-ready metadata.

## Private source assets located
The project sources include a U.S. CAM workbook and UK KAM workbooks in the researcher's private Google Drive, plus the revised AuditBERT/KAM manuscript supplied by Maryam Khosravian via Gmail.

Raw data are not committed here because source rights and redistribution permissions must be respected.

## Manuscript data notes
The revised manuscript describes a large CAM/KAM research corpus spanning U.S. and European public companies and an AuditBERT/FinBERT/LLaMA workflow. Before publication, sample-count and topic-count statements should be reconciled across the abstract and methodology.

## Quick start
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python prepare_cam_kam_data.py --input synthetic_cam_kam_sample.csv --output prepared_demo
```

For a private real-data run, point `--input` to an authorized local export of the CAM/KAM data.

## Research integrity
This package is for reproducibility, research and teaching. It does not provide an audit opinion and should not be used as a substitute for professional judgment or applicable auditing standards.
