# Open Agentic Accounting & Audit Lab

**Version 0.3 — updated 24 September 2026**

A provider-neutral research and teaching project for testing AI agents in **financial accounting, auditing, ICFR/internal control, corporate governance, CAM/KAM, IFRS, and ESG/sustainability reporting**.

## Research objective

The project separates the **reasoning model** from the **accounting/audit procedure**, evidence layer, deterministic controls, and human approval. The same case can therefore be tested with Claude, GPT/Codex, Gemini, Microsoft/Azure-hosted models, Kimi, DeepSeek, or local models while keeping the domain workflow fixed.

## Current research design

- **30 cases** across the United States, Europe and Asia.
- **7 experimental conditions (T0–T6)** from human-only work to provider-neutral, cross-model, control-gated AI with human approval.
- **210 core case-treatment cells** before model-provider replications.
- Up to approximately **1,260 case-treatment-provider cells** when six AI provider families are included, subject to the final replication protocol.
- Ten specialist agents plus an Orchestrator: Financial Accounting, Audit Testing, Evidence, ICFR/Internal Control, Corporate Governance, CAM, KAM, IFRS, ESG and Reviewer.

## Provider comparison

The research platform is structured to compare the same accounting or audit task across:

**OpenAI GPT/Codex | Anthropic Claude | Google Gemini | Microsoft/Azure | Kimi/Moonshot | DeepSeek | optional local Ollama models**

Provider choice must not change the underlying accounting procedure, gold-standard evidence or evaluation metric.

## Scientific rule

**Evidence before narrative.** Every material conclusion should be traceable to source evidence, deterministic calculations, model/version metadata, failed checks, disagreements, and reviewer decisions. Model output is not treated as audit evidence merely because it is fluent.

## Licensing rule

Third-party projects are linked rather than copied by default. Their current licenses must be checked and frozen for every experiment. Source-available software is not described as open source unless its license qualifies. Copyrighted standards content, including IFRS material, must not be redistributed without appropriate permission.

## Status

**Research scaffold + integrated proposal + provider configuration are complete.** The next implementation milestone is the first executable pilot case with a frozen evidence packet, gold-standard answer, deterministic validators, provider-specific runs and a human-review record.

This project is for research and education. It does not issue audit opinions, assurance conclusions, legal conclusions or authoritative IFRS interpretations.


## Profile-level open-source index

The integrated lab is also indexed from the umbrella repository:

- [Free & Open-Source Accounting, Audit and Assurance Stack](../../OPEN_SOURCE_ACCOUNTING_AUDIT_STACK.md)

This profile-level catalogue links verified open-source accounting/audit tools, source-available research components, public datasets, provider families, and related Saehon repositories.


## New paper and benchmark integration

- [Taming the Modern Prometheus paper package](../papers/taming-modern-prometheus/README.md)
- [13-row agentic financial assurance benchmark](../open-data/taming-modern-prometheus/README.md)
- [2026 free/open accounting, audit and ESG agent catalogue](../OPEN_AGENT_CATALOG_2026.md)
- Kaggle package: [dataset](../kaggle/datasets/taming-modern-prometheus/) and [notebook](../kaggle/notebooks/taming-modern-prometheus/)
- Hugging Face package: [dataset card and upload files](../huggingface/datasets/taming-modern-prometheus/)

The new benchmark applies the lab's evidence-before-narrative rule to public-derived accounting checks and labelled synthetic falsification cases.
