# Free & Open-Source Accounting, Audit and Assurance Stack

**Profile-level index for the Saehon research ecosystem — updated 24 September 2026**

This page connects the **Open Agentic Accounting & Audit Lab** with free/open-source or research-accessible tools that can be tested across GPT/Codex, Claude, Gemini, Microsoft/Azure, Kimi, DeepSeek and local models.

> **Licensing rule:** "free", "open source", and "source available" are not the same. The categories below use current GitHub license metadata where available. Always freeze the exact upstream version and re-check the license before redistribution or commercial use.

## Main integrated project

- **Open Agentic Accounting & Audit Lab**  
  https://github.com/Saehon/Saeid-Homayoun/tree/main/Open-Agentic-Accounting-Audit-Lab

The project integrates financial accounting, audit testing, ICFR/internal control, corporate governance, CAM/KAM, IFRS, ESG, evidence verification, deterministic controls, cross-model challenge and human approval.

## Free/research-accessible components requiring license review

| Project | Status | Role | Upstream |
|---|---|---|---|
| AI4SustainableX | Source-available / license requires direct review | ESG and sustainability reporting workflows | https://github.com/lokeshbohra/ai4sustainablex |
| LiteLLM | Public source; GitHub license metadata currently reports NOASSERTION | Provider-neutral model gateway | https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm |

Do not label these as OSI open source solely because the repositories are public. Review the current LICENSE/terms before bundling or redistribution.

## Provider families to benchmark

The same accounting/audit case should be run with a frozen toolchain while changing only the model/provider layer:

- OpenAI GPT / Codex
- Anthropic Claude
- Google Gemini
- Microsoft/Azure-hosted model services
- Kimi / Moonshot
- DeepSeek
- optional local models through Ollama or comparable runtimes

## Scientific boundary

The integrated stack is for **education, academic research, simulation and benchmarking**. A public repository, a passing test, or a successful agent run does not establish audit assurance, regulatory approval, accounting correctness, IFRS authority, commercial readiness or superiority over professional systems.

**Evidence before narrative. Human accountability remains required for material professional conclusions.**


## Taming the Modern Prometheus release

The catalogue and benchmark are now connected to the cybernetic-control article package:

- [Free/Open Agent and Tool Catalogue 2026](OPEN_AGENT_CATALOG_2026.md)
- [Taming the Modern Prometheus paper package](papers/taming-modern-prometheus/README.md)
- [Agentic Financial Assurance Benchmark](open-data/taming-modern-prometheus/README.md)
- [Kaggle dataset package](kaggle/datasets/taming-modern-prometheus/)
- [Hugging Face dataset package](huggingface/datasets/taming-modern-prometheus/)

The benchmark contains three public-derived Microsoft aggregate checks and ten explicitly synthetic gate cases. It is a research and education scaffold, not audit evidence or a professional assurance conclusion.
